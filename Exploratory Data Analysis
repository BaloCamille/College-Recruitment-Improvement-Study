*Exploratory Data Analysis*

The first step to analyzing and synthesizing from a dataset is to first understand the relationships between various attributes. This starts with answering preliminary and essential questions about the dataset. For this project, the CCM Computing Literacy Course Entry Survey will be used to answer the following questions:
    1. How many students from each different class responded to the survey?
    2. What are the gender percentages?
    3. What is the racial/ethnic diversity?
    4. What is the age distribution for the survey?
    5. What impact do CCM events such as the Women Who Dare and the CyberSecurity Information Protection Program differ based on gender?
    6. What was the most common motivating factor to attend CCM for each gender?
    7. What is percentage of students who are not the "average" age for college (17-24), and what are there reasons for taking a technology class?
    8. How interested are students who were motivated to attend CCM by the choice of programs in taking other technology courses? Of the technology courses offered 
       in the survey, which were the most popular?
