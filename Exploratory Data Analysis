*Exploratory Data Analysis*

The first step to analyzing and synthesizing from a dataset is to first understand the relationships between various attributes. This starts with answering preliminary and essential questions about the dataset. For this project, the CCM Computing Literacy Course Entry Survey's 131 respondents will be used to answer the following questions:
    1. How many students from each different class responded to the survey?
    2. What are the gender percentages?
    3. What is the racial/ethnic diversity?
    4. What is the age distribution for the survey?
    5. How does the distribution of those who do CCM events such as the Women Who Dare and the CyberSecurity Information Protection Program differ based on gender?
    6. What was the most common motivating factor to take a technology course for each gender?
    7. What is percentage of students who are not the "average" age for college (17-24), and what are there reasons for taking a technology class?
    8. How does the interest in taking another technology course differ between gender? Between races/ethnicities? Ages?

*How many students from each different class responded to the survey?*
    Counts:
    CMP 101 Computer Information Literacy: 28
    CMP 126 Computer Technology and Applications: 22
    CMP 135 Computer Concepts with Applications: 81
    
    Percentages:
    CMP 101 Computer Information Literacy: 21.4%
    CMP 126 Computer Technology and Applications: 16.8%
    CMP 135 Computer Concepts with Applications: 61.8%
    
    From these statistics, it can be concluded that the most common course taken for those that responded to the Literacy Survey is CMP 135 Computer Concepts with 
    Applications, with 81 total respondents taking that course-- 61.8% of the total dataset. On the other side, the least common course taken was CMP 126 Computer 
    Technology and Applications, with almost 17% of the respondents taking the course-- 22 people in total.


*What are the gender percentages?*
    Count:
    Male: 52
    Female: 77
    Prefer not to say: 2
    
    Percentage:
    Male: 39.7%
    Female: 58.8%
    Prefer not to say: 1.5%
    
    From the statistics, it can be concluded that females made up the majority of the dataset, with 77 total females, approximately 58.8% of all the respondents.   
    Males made up a significantly smaller percentage compared to the females, with just under 40% of respondents being male. It is also important to note that two 
    respondents answered with "Prefer not to say" when asked about their gender. 


*What is the racial/ethnic diversity?*
    Count:
    Hispanic/Latino: 31
    White/Caucasian: 52
    Black/African Amercian: 13
    Asian: 11
    Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native: 2
    Multi-Racial: 17
    Choose not to say: 5
    
    Percentage:
    Hispanic/Latino: 23.7%
    White/Caucasian: 39.7%
    Black/African Amercian: 9.9%
    Asian: 8.4%
    Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native: 1.5%
    Multi-Racial: 13.0%
    Choose not to say: 3.8%
    
    Responses that contained more than one race or ethnicity were re-assigned to the Multi-Racial category except for the two respondents who answered "Native 
    American/American Indian/Alaska Native" for ease of determining the distributions of those in the dataset. The most common race/ethnicity is White/Caucasian, 
    with just under 40% of the dataset responding in that manner. The next most common is Hispanic/Latino, making up 23.7% of the dataset--another significantly 
    large portion-- and 13% for those who answered with Multi-Racial (and those that were re-assigned to the Multi-Racial category). Those that responded Asian and 
    those that responded Black/African American have approximately the same counts, with 11 specifying Asian and 13 specifying Black/African American. The least 
    common race/ethnicity was the Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native category, with 2 respondents--approximately 1.5% of the dataset.


*What is the age distribution for the survey?*
    Count:
    18 and younger: 44
    19-20: 44
    21-24: 22
    25-34: 16
    35-64: 5
    
    Percentage:
    18 and younger: 33.6%
    19-20: 33.6%
    21-24: 16.8%
    25-34: 12.2%
    35-64: 3.8%
    
    Those 20 or younger make up approximately 67.2%, with both the 18 and younger category and the 19-20 year old category having 44 respondents. The least common 
    age group represented in the dataset is the 35-64 year old group, with just under 4% of the respondents in the dataset specifiying their age as 35 or older.


*How does the distribution of those who do CCM events such as the Women Who Dare and the CyberSecurity Information Protection Program differ based on gender?*
    ~Women Who Dare Participants based on Gender (responded "Yes")~
        Male: 0
        Female: 1
        Prefer not to say: 0
    ~CyberSecurity Information Protection Program Participants based on Gender (responded "Yes")~
        Male: 0
        Female: 0
        Prefer not to say: 0
    ~CyberSecurity Information Protection Program Participants based on Gender (responded "Not Sure")~
        Male: 3
        Female: 1
        Prefer not to say: 1
        
    As shown by the statistics, for almost all of the respondents of the Literary Survey, prior to applying at CCM, only one female had participated in an event 
    hosted by the college-- the Women Who Dare program. No respondent--neither male nor female (nor Prefer not to say) answered that they attended the CyberSecurity 
    Information Protection Program. However, three males, one female, and one Prefer not to say responded that they were "Not Sure" whether they attended the 
    CyberSecurity Information Protection Program. While this may have been inaccurate, since it is represented in the data, it is included.

    Prefer not to say: 0% (count: 0 out of 2)
    
    As shown in the data's statistics, the most common motivating factor to take a technology course for males, females, and those who prefer not to say is that the 
    course is a required class, with 92.2% of females, 75% of males, and 50% of those who prefer not to say responding as such. However, besides the class being 
    required, the next most common motivation factor for females was Career Advancement, with 42.9% of females stating that was their reason for taking a technology 
    course. For males, at 57.5%, was To keep current in computing skills.

    Count of those 24 or younger: 110
    Percentage of those 24 or younger: 84.0%
    
    Count of those 25 or older: 21
    Percentage of those 25 or older: 16.0%
    
    Career Advancement Motivation (responded "Yes"):
    Total: 42.7% (count: 56 out of 131)

    Required Class Motivation (responded "Yes"):
    Total: 84.7% (count: 111 out of 131)
    24 or younger: 83.6% (count: 92 out of 110)
    25 or older: 90.5% (count: 19 out of 21)
    
    To keep current in computing skills Motivation (responded "Yes"):
    Total: 48.1% (count: 63 out of 131)
    24 or younger: 47.3% (count: 52 out of 110)
    25 or older: 52.4% (count: 11 out of 21)

    25 or older: 42.9% (count: 9 out of 21)
    
    As shown by the statistics, the most common choice chosen in the dataset for the motivation of taking a technology course is that the class is required for their 
    program, with 84.7% of all the age groups stating as such. Moreover, for both age groups, the Required Class motivation remains the most common reason for taking 
    a technology course. Besides that, however, for those 24 and younger, the most common reason is To keep current in computing skills, with 47.3% of those in that 
    age group responding "Yes." On the other side, for those 25 and older, the most common reason is also To keep current in computing skills, with 52.4% of those in 
    this age groups responding "Yes." 
    

*How does the interest in taking another technology course differ between gender? Between races/ethnicities? Ages?*
    Interest based on Gender:
    Male:

*Insights*

    1. What impact do CCM events such as the Women Who Dare and the CyberSecurity Information Protection Program have on women? On men?
        As shown previously in the preliminary data analysis of the Technology Literacy survey, the outreach events hosted by CCM--specifically the Women Who Dare 
        and the CyberSecurity Information Protection Program had an insignificant impact on both males and females on choosing to attend CCM, with only one female 
        stating she attended the Women Who Dare event and no one stating they were a part of the CyberSecurity Information Protection Program. From this data, it can 
        be inferred that CCM's events that aim at a gender minority and that aim at attracting all students to the technology program is insufficient and negligible 
        in both engaging and retaining students, regardless of gender. To improve this outcome, more research and surveys will need to be taken to determine why 
        students aren't interested in these events and what can be done to improve the events so more students would want to attend. Using the other responses in the 
        Computer Literacy Survey would also be useful in determining what each gender's motivation was for taking a technology course. As discovered in the 
        preliminary data analysis, for females, the most common reasons were that the course was required for their major (92.2%) and Career Advancement (42.9%), and 
        for males, the most common reasons were also that the course was required for their major (75%) and to keep current in computing skills (57.5%). With this 
        further information, CCM can tailor the events and programs they host to better suit the motivations for students to take technology courses. For example, 
        the Women Who Dare event could be more tailored to advancement for females when entering the workforce, and for the technology department in particular, for 
        women entering the STEM field due to them being a significant minority compared to their STEM male counterparts. Moreover, the technology department in 
        particular could host an event for all majors about the latest technology, applications, and computing skills that would aid them best for their future and 
        help develop students in those areas. However, these two proposals fail to address the largest issue that the technology department seems to be having with 
        their retention of students--the fact that the largest motivating factor is that the technology course they are taking is required by their major, not that 
        are actually interested in taking such a course. This may be due to various reasons including students not understanding the importance of technology and 
        computer literacy for both personal and professional reasons, not having an interest in technology, or any other combination of reasons. To combat this, the 
        technology department could incorporate greater emphasis on the importance of computer and technology literacy in the required classes as well as add a few 
        subjects to those courses that could spark interest in the students, both of which could potentially increase the amount of students who return to the  
        technology department to take another class.
    2. How interested are students of different races/ethnicities in taking another technology course at CCM? What could be done to increase the technology 
       department's retention of minorities? How could the technology department increase diversity and inclusion in their programs?
        As shown previously in the preliminary data analysis of the Technology Literacy survey, the race/ethnicity most interested in taking another technology 
        course was Black/African American, with 38.5% stating they were highly interested in doing so. The least likely were Native American/American Indian/Alaska 
        Native (100%), Asian (63.6%), and Multi-Racial (52.9%), with all three of the races/ethnicities stating that they were not interested in taking another 
        technology course (responding with either a 1 or 2). While more surveys and research would need to be conducted to hone in on what attracts minorities to the 
        technology courses to determine the most effective retainment factors to aid in the diversity and inclusion of the technology department. However, with the 
        current information and the other data provided by the survey, some retainment and inclusivity initiatives that could be brought to the technology department 
        could include a greater emphasis on the importance of diversity and inclusivity as it relates to STEM. As shown previously, events and programs hosted by CCM 
        and by the technology department have little impact in students' decision to attend CCM (at least in the case of the dataset's respondents). As such, an 
        event or program may not be the most effective in aiding the technology department's recruitment and retainment of racial and ethnic minorities. However, 
        that isn't to say it would be completely ineffective. After all, if the events and programs were tailored to the specific needs and wants of the demographic 
        they are targetting, such initiatives could be beneficial to their cause. However, the distribution of those that responded to the survey as taking a 
        technology course was fairly diverse, with 23.7% Hispanic/Latino respondents and 13% those stating they are Multi-Racial (this could, however, be considered 
        low as well in some cases). One minority group that had a significantly lower percentage than the previously stated minorities is the Black/African American 
        group, representing 9.9% of the dataset. This could mean that the college as a whole and in conjuction, the technology department (since all respondents are 
        taking a technology course), doesn't necessarily have issues with diversity and inclusivity already--even with the Multi-Racial and Black/African American 
        minority groups having significantly lower distributions, the general diversity seen in the dataset isn't highly skewed to being non-minority centric (the 
        White/Caucasian group made up 39.7% of the dataset, and while this is substantially higher than the other racial and ethnic groups represented in the survey, 
        it is still significantly below 50%).

*Future Questions*

    1. How interested are students who were motivated to attend CCM by the choice of programs in taking other technology courses? Of the technology courses offered 
       in the survey, which were the most popular?
    2. How does the motivating factor to take a technology course differ based on race/ethnicity?
